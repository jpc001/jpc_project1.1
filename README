  -----------------
  Development Setup
  -----------------


  The repository only contains source material. Some files need to be generated
  when running under Eclipse

  To use within a shell window
  -----------------------------
  No changes needed. Simply invoke buildr compile, buildr test, etc


  To use within Eclipse
  ------------------------
  Generate the project and classpath files using
    buildr eclipse

  Then generate the ant script (thin shell calling BuildR) using:
    buildr ant

  Start Eclipse, import the project (do not copy to workspace) and
  load the ant script. Tasks can then be called from within Eclipse
  using the Ant panel.
